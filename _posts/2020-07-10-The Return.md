We're back! It's been a long time since we dedicated a considerable amount of time to the project, but we're ready to get back to it after that month break! Getting back onto our feet, we had a lengthy meeting about how we should go about solving some of the issues we last discussed.

# Assessing Issues, Stating Standards
We last left off with the issue of not having much interaction against Objects. Most of the playtest showed players allowing Objects to continue being on the field without much counterplay. After some deduction of our strategies, we found the reason to be that attacking Objects were not usually worth the use of an Attack. This sprouted a whole new chain of discussions about how Attacks should really work in the game.

There were a lot of words, ideas, and memes thrown around, but we somehow settled on making these changes:
+ Four Attacks are chosen and work separately from the deck. Creatures always have an Attack for the Attack phase on the Player's turn.
+ A new mana system will be tested that will control how many cards can be used in a turn.
+ A new mechanic idea for the single-player adventure mode. Shh, it's a secret!

We found that Attacks happened to be crucially important to how a match flows and goes. Rather than having Attack cards that would give the possibility of not being able to Attack in a turn, we want to try a new system that will allow Attacks to always occur. Furthermore, instead of having a set limitation of card types that can be played, we will be trying a mana system instead. This will allow more strategy and possibilities of play/counterplay, giving the player the capability of executing more powerful combos in exchange of defensive options that would require mana as well (such as Reaction cards).

# Keys and Words

Another important topic we discussed was creating standard language for the design of the game. This will help prevent any confusing wording or repeated wording that could happen from three different people designing cards. While it would be funny to see to see cards that can stun, paralyze, or spook, it could end up rather confusing and inconvenient to describe the effect ocurring.

So then we created a standards document about what **Keywords** we would be using for the cards, as well as what limitations the cards shouldn't be able to do. You may recognize some of the common ones such as **Taunt** or **Summon**, which is easy to convey to the player as this kind of language is common amongst other games. Personally though, I still want Spook to be a Keyword.


Next time, we'll put this new proposed system to the test. The battles will be fierce and fast. Hopefully. We'll be keeping you updated on the progress!
