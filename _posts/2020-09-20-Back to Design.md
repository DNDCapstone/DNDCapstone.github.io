# Prototype Advancements

As we previously mentioned, DND has been working on a prototype to show basic attacks in Unreal. Our process was to take a vertical slice of our attack system and then go back and revise it. Currently we are in the revision phase of our attacks and deck cycling, but we are taking it slow from a development standpoint.

# Overall Design Focus

Aside from our attack prototype, we are transitioning back to planning out the design of our game. Since a lot of our game needs planned out, we are keeping it simple and brainstorming through the creation of multiple moodboards. Aside from this, we are also brainstorming what everything will look like in the game. This will be a multi-week process so expect more updates on this as we go forward.
