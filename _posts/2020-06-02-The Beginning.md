*(As a sidenote, this post was created a couple weeks after we started, so some info might be missing)*

# How We Started
We figured out before starting that we wanted to create a RPG-style game using a unique battle mechanic. In our case, we wanted to make the combat system to be a card game, which hasn't been explored much in games up to this point.

Since the combat system is going to be the focus of our game, we decided to each spend the first week creating a card game that could fit the following requirements:

+ 1v1 Creature Combat
+ Creatures evolve during the game
+ Defeat the opposing Creature to win

We intentionally left the requirements open-ended in order to have the most freedom in game creation.

Then, we planned to regroup a week later to play and discuss our individual prototypes.
