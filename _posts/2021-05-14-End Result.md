# Project Update

Hello! It's been a while since an update for X-iled was given. A final milestone has been reached for our capstone project so here's an update on what has happened.

# Playtests

Throughout this last semester (January - May 2021) we attempted 3 playtests, but our main one we benefited from was our second one. This was a live playtest with people, so a lot of great feedback was gathered. In this playtest people got to experience our procedural level generation and new loot system, so a bunch of feedback was given to improve both. 

# Enemies and Art

New enemy AI was also added to have proper pathfinding and use proper assets! Enemies get stronger the longer you play, and you can even come accross extra strong enemies who drop special attacks! Along with enemy assets, the entire game has improved assets! This includes the walls, environment, player, enemies, and even moves have particle systems.

# User Interface

In response to players getting lost in the procedurally generated levels, we created a minimap on the UI so players could see where they have and haven't been on the map! This also shows you when you've found the exit for the level, marked by a yellow square.

# Upcoming info

X-iled is complete for a base rogue-lite experience, but is capable of being expanded upon. We hope to have the game released on itch soon, so keep an eye out for that!
